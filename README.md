After cloning this repository, copy its content to the root directory on your server.
If you work on xampp, then the htdocs directory will look like that:
- frontend
- frontend_source
- backend
- .htaccess
- index.php


in the backend directory, run: <code>composer install</code>

visit <code>http://localhost</code>
that's it!
